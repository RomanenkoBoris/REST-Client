REST-Client
This is my first REST client, which could be part of a healthy eating application.
The users receive information about the nutritional properties of a selected fruit or all fruits, allowing them to compare values and make informed decisions.
While working on this project, I explored the world of REST APIs, learned about several new libraries and services.
There's more to come...
